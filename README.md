# py_riddle
A set of interactive riddles written  with python


## New Stable Refactored script v2.0
- Replaced Colorama with [yachalk](https://github.com/bluenote10/yachalk) in some modules.
- Code is now dynamic, easier to add more riddles without messing with **main.py**.
###### Note: There are many ways to achieve this, this is just one method.
## New Stable Update v1.20
- Added Colors and Style using Colorama
- You may need [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701) to view all effects on Windows, as **CMD** does not fully support colors.
